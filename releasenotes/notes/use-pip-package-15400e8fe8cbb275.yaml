    The ``tempest`` class now installs the pip command using the distribution
    package instead of the ``easy_install`` command for CentOS, because
    the command is no longer provided by the setuptool package now. Note that
    RHEL does not have the pip package so the package installation is skipped.
    Make sure the pip command is installed before the class is executed.
